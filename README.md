# 🚗 US Traffic Accident Analysis (Tableau Project)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project involved creating an interactive Tableau dashboard for a comprehensive analysis of U.S. car accidents, visualizing their distribution and the influence of environmental and road factors on accident severity.

## 📸 Key Findings (Static Visuals)

The image of Tableau dashboard is shown as the US Accidents Analysis.png. Our analysis of U.S. traffic accidents shows clear patterns:


* Accidents are most frequent in coastal and highly populated states, confirming the link between traffic flow and accident counts.
* Urban areas have more but less severe accidents, while rural areas face fewer but more serious ones.
* Accidents peak between August and December, showing a seasonal trend.
* Visibility — not temperature or humidity — is the main weather factor that affects how severe accidents become, especially at night.
* Traffic signals help reduce accidents, especially at crossings.

  
Together, these insights show how geography, road design, and weather all shape road safety across the United States.
