# 🚗 US Traffic Accident Analysis (Tableau Project)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project involved creating an interactive Tableau dashboard for a comprehensive analysis of U.S. car accidents, visualizing their distribution and the influence of environmental and road factors on accident severity.

* Our analysis of U.S. traffic accidents shows clear patterns:
* (1)Accidents are most frequent in coastal and highly populated states, confirming the link between traffic flow and accident counts.
* (2)Urban areas have more but less severe accidents, while rural areas face fewer but more serious ones.
* (3)Accidents peak between August and December, showing a seasonal trend.
* (4)Visibility — not temperature or humidity — is the main weather factor that affects how severe accidents become, especially at night.
* (5)Traffic signals help reduce accidents, especially at crossings.
* Together, these insights show how geography, road design, and weather all shape road safety across the United States.
